# Python has a rich ecosystem of packages and modules that can be used to get the most out of the language.
# A package is essentially a directory that contains multiple modules and subpackages.
# A module is a single file that contains a collection of related functions, classes, and variables.
# Modules are the basic building blocks of Python code organization.
# A module can be thought of as a container that holds a set of related code.
